# Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tom, I am from Bray co Wicklow, a city south of Dublin in Ireland.

I just graduated full stack software development with Code [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) and aim to become one of the top software developper :grin:

I have always been a problem solver and I believe that it is a skill that is mostly transferable to any job really... but I am also driven by growth, improvement and greatness !!!
Having a background as a manager in a high level restaurant, I really enjoy challenges. I try to execute and produce in the best way possible. It feels good when you do *your* best and *the* best in something! It's great for you, your team, and the customer!
I really enjoy life, it's amazing! I believe you can achieve anything as a game where in order to win, you need to accomplish some tasks. I am a serious guy though, but I like to challenge myself that way! :smile:

As well I have an interest in Solving problems, the Universe and Nature!

I feel that moving into software development is what I need. It ticks all my boxes and resonate with me.

I engage with the community throught Slack, open-source project and hackathon! I solve coding challenges on CodeSignal regularly to stay sharp :) 

I can wait to learn more and contribute to the world!

:flushed: PS: I like using exclamation mark !!!:nerd_face:
