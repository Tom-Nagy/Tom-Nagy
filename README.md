# Hello everyone ðŸ‘‹

My name is Tom, I am from Bray co Wicklow, a city south of Dublin in Ireland :ireland:

At the moment, I am studying full stack software development with Code [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) in order to become one of the top software developper :grin:

I have always been a problem solver and I beleive that it is a skill that is mostly transferable to any job really... but I am also driven by growth, impovement and greatness !!! Having a background as a manager in hight level restaurtion industry, I really enjoy challenge and try to execute and produce in the best way possible. It feels good when you do your best and the best in something for you, your team and the customer!
I really enjoy life, it's great! I beleive you can acomplish anything as a game where in order to win, you need to do some tasks. I am a serious guy though, but I like to challenge myself that way! I like playing :smile:

As well I have an interest in Mathematics and Universe. They fascinate me!

I feel that moving into software development is what I need. It ticks all my boxes and resonate with me. Completing the last project of the course at the really exists me! 

I can wait to learn more and contribute to the world!

:flushed: ps: I like using exclamation mark !!!:nerd_face:
